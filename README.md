# Getting Started with Bun and Vite

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) and utilizes [Bun](https://bun.sh/) as the package manager and runtime environment.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

**`bun dev`**

-   Runs the app in development mode.
-   Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in your browser.
-   The page will reload if you make edits.
-   You will also see any lint errors in the console.

**`bun run test`**

-   Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
-   Refer to [running tests](https://bun.sh/docs/cli/test) for more information.

**`bun run build`**

-   Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.
-   It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
